## Usage

Add a step to your [workflow] in order to receive [Telegram] notifications, for example:

```yml
- name: notification
  if: cancelled() == false
  uses: xinthink/action-telegram@v1
  with:
    botToken: ${{ secrets.BotToken }}
    chatId: ${{ secrets.ChatID }}
    jobStatus: ${{ job.status }}
```

> You can find more details in [action.yml]

The [Telegram] message will look like:
  - BOT name

    ðŸ”´ [owner/repo]() Check **Failure**

    `refs/heads/master` `5cabc6f` by **author**

    [View details]()

> Where `Check` will be the name of your workflow

## Development

[Yarn] is preferred for everyday tasks, so there's a `yarn.lock` instead of `package-lock.json` on the *master* branch. We will use [yarn run] ([npm scripts]) for handling the *node_modules* stuff, and also compiling [TypeScript] sources.

- Run command `yarn release` before committing to *release* branches
- Run command `yarn dev` before doing development tasks or committing to the *master* branch
